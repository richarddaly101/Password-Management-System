# Password-Management-System
A password manager created with Bash. Allows for multiple users to access and modify their passwords on the system simultaneously. 

The password manager is built on a client-server model to mimic centralised password managers such as Bitwarden (https://bitwarden.com/), Lastpass (https://www.lastpass.com) or 1password (https://1password.com/).
